 Rules</H2><BR><BR>
<h3 align=center>
There are 5 ways that a franchise can acquire a player: In the annual auction, signing domestic players, signing uncapped players, through trading, and signing replacements.<BR> In the trading window, the player can only be traded with his consent.<BR> The franchise will have to pay the difference between the old contract price and the new contract price.<BR> If the new contract is worth more than the older one, then the difference will be shared between the player and the franchise selling the player.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the team composition rules are:
<BR>
Minimum squad strength of 16 players plus one physio and a coach.<BR><BR>
No more than 11 foreign players in the squad and maximum 4 foreign players should be in the playing eleven.<BR>
Minimum of 14 Indian players must be included in each squad.<BR>
A minimum of 6 players from the BCCI under-22 pool in each squad.<BR><BR>
IPL games utilize television timeouts, hence there is no time limit for teams to complete their innings.<BR> However, there may be a penalty if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege at their own choice.<BR> Additionally, each team is awarded two strategic timeouts of 2:30 each per innings—the teams can take the timeout when instructed, but is necessary to take it from 6th to 9th and 13th to 16th over.<BR>
<BR>
The total spending cap for a franchisee in the first player auction was US $5 million.<BR> Under-22 players are to be remunerated with a minimum annual salary of US $20,000 while for others it is US $50,000.<BR> The most expensive players in the IPL to date is Gautam Gambhir of India fetched the highest price of $2.4 million from Kolkata Knight Riders at the auction for season 4<BR>

Television rights and sponsorships
<BR><BR><BR>
The IPL is expected to bring the BCCI an income of approximately US$1.6 billion, over a period of five to ten years.<BR> All of these revenues are directed to a central pool, 40% of which will go to IPL itself, 54% to franchisees and 6% as prize money.<BR> The money will be distributed in these proportions until 2017, after which the share of IPL will be 50%, franchisees 45% and prize money 5%.<BR> The IPL signed up Kingfisher Airlines as the official umpire partner for the series in a 106 crore (US$20 million) (approximately £15 million) deal.<BR> This deal sees the Kingfisher Airlines brand on all umpires' uniforms and also on the giant screens during third umpire decisions.<BR>
<BR><BR>
 Television rights
<BR>
On 17 January 2008 it was announced that a consortium consisting of India's Sony Entertainment Television network and Singapore-based World Sport Group secured the global broadcasting rights of the Indian Premier League.<BR><BR> The record deal has a duration of ten years at a cost of US $1.026 billion.<BR> As part of the deal, the consortium will pay the BCCI US $918 million for the television broadcast rights and US $108 million for the promotion of the tournament.<BR> <BR>This deal was challenged in the Bombay High Court by IPL, and got the ruling on its side.<BR> After losing the battle in court, Sony Entertainment Television signed a new contract with BCCI with Sony Entertainment Television paying 8700 crore (US$1.6 billion) for 10 years.<BR> One of the reasons for payment of this huge amount is seen as the money required to subsidise IPL's move to South Africa which will be substantially more than the previous IPL.<BR> IPL had agreed to subsidise the difference in operating cost between India and South Africa as it decided to move to the African nation after the security concerns raised because of its coincidence with India's general elections.<BR>
<BR><BR>
20% of these proceeds would go to IPL, 8% as prize money and 72% would be distributed to the franchisees.<BR> The money would be distributed in these proportions until 2012, after which the IPL would go public and list its shares (But in March 2010, IPL decided not to go public).<BR>
<BR><BR>
Sony-WSG then re-sold parts of the broadcasting rights geographically to other companies.<BR>It is officially broadcasted on Set Max and in internet in Times internet.<BR>
<BR><BR>
On 4 March 2010 ITV announced it had secured the United Kingdom television rights for the 2010 Indian Premier League.<BR> ITV will televise 59 of the 60 IPL matches on its ITV4 free to air channel.<BR>
<BR><BR>
On 1 April 2011, Rogers Media announced that it signed a four year exclusive deal in Canada to broadcast 36 group stage matches, 3 playoff matches and 1 championship match on its channel Sportsnet One.<BR> In the 2012 season, its coverage will also include a weekly highlight show and four matches on its Omni Television multicultural stations, and the IPL Final will be broadcast on the main Sportsnet regional channels.<BR><BR><BR>
