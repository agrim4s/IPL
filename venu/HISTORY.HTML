PepsiCo replaced DLF Ltd as the title sponsor starting with the 2013 season.<BR> DLF did not renew their contract after their initial five-year contract, for 250 crore, ended with the previous season.<BR> It was speculated[by whom?] that their choice was attributed to the slump in the real estate market and the decline in the IPL's television ratings over the previous two years.<BR> PepsiCo's contract is 396.8 crore for five years, ending with the 2017 season
Deccan Chargers, champions of 2009 Indian Premier League, became the second team to be terminated from the IPL after Kochi Tuskers Kerala.<BR> The owners failed to save the team after several attempts were made with the Bombay High Court and Supreme Court of India.<BR> Immediately after the Chargers' termination, the BCCI invited bidders for a replacement team also based in Hyderabad.<BR> It was announced on 25 October 2012 that Sun TV Network won the bid at 85.05 crore per year.<BR>The new team was named the Sunrisers Hyderabad
In October 2012, the teams were allowed to release any number of their players from their contracts to reduce their player costs.<BR> The released players would enter the auction.<BR> Starting from this season, domestic players will be put into auction.<BR> The players' auction will be held on 3 February 2013.<BR> 37 players were sold at the auction.<BR>
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional league for Twenty20 cricket championship in India.<BR> It was initiated by Lalit Modi , who served as the league's first Chairman and Commissioner and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtraand is supervised by BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla, who serves as the league's Chairman and Commissioner.<BR> It is currently contested by nine teams, consisting of players from around the cricketing world.<BR> It was started after an altercation between the BCCI and the Indian Cricket League.<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
In 2010, IPL became the first sporting event ever to be broadcast live on YouTube.<BR> Its brand value is estimated to be around US$2.99 billion in fifth season.<BR> However, the league has been engulfed by series of corruption scandals where allegations of cricket betting, money laundering and spot fixing were witnessed.<BR>
<BR><BR><BR><BR>
The Premier League is generally considered to be the world's showcase for Twenty20 cricket, a shorter format of cricket consisting only 20 overs.<BR> Top Indian and international players take part in IPL, contributing to what is the world's "richest cricket tournament".<BR>
